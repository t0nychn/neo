Against seemingly insurmountable odds, grime’s teenage pioneers sent out a signal from the pirate radio aerials and crumbling estates of London’s poorest boroughs that would, 15 years later, resonate as the universal sound of youthful rebellion, as big in the suburbs as in the inner city.\r\nBy 2018, the likes of Dizzee Rascal, Wiley and Skepta have long since become household names. But have the conditions that produced this music now gone forever? What happens to those living on the margins when those margins become ever-smaller spaces? And what happens to a rebellious, outsider sound when it is fully accepted by the pop cultural mainstream? Inner City Pressure tells the astonishing story of a generation dancing, fighting and rioting against the forces gentrifying the capital.Dan Hancox  – Inner City Pressure: The Story of GrimeBook\n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            £10Book £10Book £9 > MEMBERS""Back in 2018, I was invited by Dave Rempis to participate in the Exposure Series at Elastic Arts in Chicago. The Series was for me a shining example of artist-lead organizing of different yet connected communities around the Music. From my standpoint, it is yet another in the continuum of such actions, specifically in Chicago, and has been a major inspiration for my work as an artist and for the material on this recording.   The ensemble was assembled by Mr. Rempis, and was the first time the group had ever played together. The experience was immensely moving and was a major event in my own musical development, having the chance to lead a collective ensemble of true pillars in Creative Music.   Later that year, I was invited back to Chicago by Ken Vandermark for the Option Series at Experimental Sound Studio. It was then when I was able to schedule a recording and subsequent concert with the group, revisiting the material conceived by the ensemble earlier that year. As for the actual composition, I wanted to showcase the collectivism of the sounds produced in that first meeting. With that in mind I listened back to the first recording and transcribed different movements, motifs, and themes, plus added a few original composition ideas. We then recorded these collective compositions, first in a private recording session, second in front of an audience at Elastic Arts, where the Quintet first met.   What is presented here on this double album is a collection of both sessions. I want to convey again the collectivity of the Quintet. The concept of being a (C)omposer is a result of centuries of musical hierarchy, regarded and celebrated as the ultimate form of a musical artist. The example set out by the journeys of many in Improvised Music, including the gentlemen on this recording, allows for exploration of ""composition"" in true collective non-hierarchical form. There are no single series of notes, timbres, and dynamics conceived previously by an individual that was then imposed. Rather the Music was allowed to be presented with equal representation from each individual. The ""Composer"" here, is merely the organizer of the spirit energy of the ensemble. This is the nature of the beautiful offering that This Music provides.""  - Luke Stewart, July 2020.\xa0\r\n---\r\nLuke Stewart - Bass, Compositions  Edward Wilkerson, Jr. - Reeds  Ken Vandermark - Reeds  Jim Baker - Piano  Avreeayl Ra - Drums\r\n---\r\nReleased: Oct 2020, Astral SpiritsLuke Stewart – Exposure Quintet2LP\n                            \n                        \n                    \n                        / \n                        \n                            DL2LP SOLD OUTDownload £6Download £5 > MEMBERSFREE WITH DIGITAL MEMBERSHIP CREDITS [?]---\r\nChris Williams / Trumpet, Cornet, Flugelhorn, Synth, Objects\r\nPatrick Shiroshi / Alto, Bari, Sopranino, Soprano and Tenor Saxophones, Clarinet, Electric Toothbrush, Glockenspiel\r\n---Engineered by: Jared RodriguezMixed and Mastered: Weston OlenckiSpecial thanks: Jared Rodriguez, Weston Olencki, Nate Cross, Amber Navran, Laura PérezChris Williams & Patrick Shiroishi – Sans SoleilDownload\n                            \n                                \n                                    \n                                        \n                                            £6Download £6Download £5 > MEMBERSFREE WITH DIGITAL MEMBERSHIP CREDITS [?]Generational Muse""Forty years ago a group of hipsters fled Manhattan for . . . has it even been that long? I cannot fathom for I’m still alive and so many of my comrades have fallen to age, to the Amerikka machine. We started our Harlem project with great promise, young energy, and foolish intent. We thought that the government should fund our liberations, and as I look back Ishmael Reed was correct in saying that we should have reached out to our black middle class business owners, lawyers and doctors for the money to free our people from the decay of racism, class difference, and n*-ism.The music was always there. For me it was the pulse of the whole enterprise, a stunning tribute to our genius. New music magicians like Sun-Ra, Ornette Coleman, Sonny and Linda Sharrock, those Ayler brothers and the like gave us the language to try anything. There were more of these visionaries than poets, and their work lives longer than any poem of mine’s will. This is no sad statement, for the soul of the African has always been linked to the beat. My own son’s generation discovered this through hip-hop, but the embracing of an instrumental music skipped the generations after its birth, the new music did not seem to make it to my\xa0son’s peers.In Cleveland, there are a few young brothers doing the “new music” without the wayward politics of their forbears, only the soul, heart and muscle of the music lives now. Vernacular, a group of three young musicians – two black men, and a white man – unaware of how crucial their enterprise will be to the coming years. I’ve come to know their journey through a young poet I know, whose head is harder than mine, but savvy is spirit, and his glows. He asked me to write to you, the listener, to give you a map of their place in history; I was not willing at first for I was feeling old, and attacked. Why should I help explain what they could only know as a lonely enterprise?As albums go, this “little bird” is passion music, I enjoyed many of the selections, I did not like their slower works, nor did I enjoy how short it was. It should have been longer, but they left me wanting, so I guess they’ve understood some things are left to the sure voice. I tease my young poet all the time, he does the same – who will be the next mover in out collected history of moving, he asks? I say don’t fret that, it will only make you a target. FBI crackers will tap your phone, and open your mail. The war against the free has come to a head.

Players can hit a 7, 8, or 10 with each turn, with the team reaching 75 points first being the winning team.Beware though… land in ‘the kitchen’ and you automatically lose 10 points. Touch a line and the points don’t count. Land in the ‘dead zone’ and your biscuit must be removed. Harsh, but definitely fun!To Book:Lanes can accommodate 2-6 players (or from 2 - 8 players if you're from a maximum of 2 households) and are bookable by 55-minute session, costing from £25 (price will vary dependent on Indoor/Outdoor Lanes and whether the booking is during a peak/off-peak time). No per head cost. We’ll leave you to do the maths! Every group is automatically allocated a seated table for 90 minutes after your shuffle game time has ended - longer if we have capacity on the day. So be sure to allow some time to stick around and make the most of our great pizzas and cocktails!Book a LaneTable ShuffleX 2 TEAMS2-6/8 PLAYERS55 MINS£32 PER TABLEDating back to the 15th century, table shuffleboard in its earliest form involved players sliding a silver penny along a table - hence the term ‘shove ha’penny’. It became so addictive, Henry VIII decided to ban it for being too distracting. Thankfully that was then, and this is now!This version of the game involves two teams of players sliding weighted pucks along a 16ft long ‘Classic’ table into the scoring zone at the other end. Players can score a 1-4 with every shot or gain a 5 for the ultimate ‘hanger’ shot. Sounds easier than it is! But it’s super addictive and gets the teams really fired up.To Book:Shuffle Tables can accommodate 2-6 players (or from 2 - 8 players if you're from a maximum of 2 households) and are bookable by 55-minute session, costing £32 per table. So no per head cost with this one either! Every group is automatically allocated a seated table for 90 minutes after your shuffle game time has ended - longer if we have capacity on the day.

85,Mayfair Tanning & Waxing,http://mayfairaestheticsandbeauty.com/,"[""London Waxing | Soho Tanning | Mayfair Aesthetics & BeautyABOUTTREATMENTSPRICESBOOKINGCONTACTBook Now Via WhatsAppAward winning beauty Clinic and SalonWelcome to Mayfair Aesthetics and Beauty, established in 2001 located just off New Bond Street and opposite House Of Fraser.A contemporary salon offering an array of luxury beauty treatments. \nFrom exclusive facials and pampering massages to your every day necessities; laser hair removal, waxing, sugaring, manicures and pedicures. We have a dedicated Tanning area with Luxury Award Winning Spray Tan and high intensity Ergoline Stand up and lie down Sun-beds.We pride ourselves on providing a quality service, our qualified experts are on hand to advise and answer any questions you might have.Please click/tap here to see our Hygiene Policy & Pre & Post Waxing advice.WAXING PRE CAREPlease arrive with clean skin (no moisturiser and preferably no makeup). Antibacterial wipes are provided to freshen up prior to intimate and underarm waxing.Hair must generally be at least 3-4mm to be waxed effectively. Please trim any very long hairs in the area if possible. A length of between 6mm (0.6cm) and 10mm (1cm) is best for comfort and results. We will happily trim for you if required using sanitised equipment, however a trimming fee may apply.If you are particularly sensitive or is this is your first wax, you may wish to take a Panadol or Nurofen 30-60 minutes prior to your appointment to take the edge of any discomfort. \nWait 2 weeks after any IPL or Laser treatment before waxing.Please advise us if you have been taking accutane or steroidal medication, or any other medication that thins the skin.Avoid applying Retin A, AHAs, or glycolic acids for 4 weeks prior to waxing.  \nWait at least 4 weeks post any superficial or medium depth peel. Wait at least 3 months post surgery.It is best for pregnant women to consult their doctor prior to any waxing, however it is generally safe to have a service after the first trimester.Do not wax if your skin is irritated, or if you have any active conditions or infections in the area such as rashes, cuts, eczema or coldsores. If you are taking Accutane, any steroidal or skin thinning medications you must let us know as you have a highly increased chance of side effects.\nIt is necessary to remove your underwear for any intimate waxing beyond a basic bikini or brief wax. You will be provided a paper towel for coverage before your treatment. All of our waxing is performed by professional female therapists.We offer a discreet service for menstruating clients. We can still sensitively proceed with your intimate waxing (please wear a tampon). We kindly ask for 24 hours notice when rescheduling to avoid charge.WAXING AFTERCAREEven with the best products and technique, skin needs time to calm post waxing. This may happen very soon after your treatment but can take between 48-72 hours. \nPlease wear loose fitting clothing after waxing until the skin has calmed. Stockings and tight jeans can lead to irritation and ingrown hairs.For intimate waxing, please ensure that you wear undergarments made of cotton so the skin can breathe. Don't wear silks or satins or until the skin has calmed..Avoid perfumes, antiperspirants and colognes in the area until the skin has calmed.\nAfter a wax, avoid chlorine pools, saunas, the gym, and hot tubs until your skin has calmed down, to minimise the risk of inflammation.Keep showers warm, not hot and do not engage in any vigorous exercise or sun exposure.\nUse sun protection at all times if outdoors. We recommend CosMedix non-irritant sunblock which we retail..Do not exfoliate and avoid any beauty treatments in the area for at least 48-72 hours and preferably a week, including spray tanning, sunbathing and sun-beds, laser, IPL, peels and massage.\nOnce the waxed area has returned to normal, gently exfoliate each day using a suitable exfoliating wash or gentle loofah and apply a moisturiser or after-wax lotion.\nUse a proper after-wax lotion such as 'Ingrown Zone' commencing 48-72 hours after the treatment, and preferable daily, especially when regrowth begins to appear, to avoid ingrown hairs or infected follicles.Once a 6mm growth has returned the area can be waxed again. Waxing appointments are generally booked 4-6 weeks apart.WAXING HEALTH AND HYGIENEUnfortunately, some salons may cut corners when it comes to hygiene. In waxing terminology 'double dipping' is the act of putting the spatula back into the pot after wax has been applied to the skin. Once the spatula touches skin, dipping it back into the wax can potentially transfer bacteria, viruses, fungus, bodily fluids and dead skin cells from the body, back into to the wax pot, to then be applied on other clients. Wax is only heated to a temperature just above 60°, which isn’t hot enough to kill microorganisms (any hotter, and the wax would scald the skin).For hygiene purposes, applicators should be disposed of after spreading wax on the skin. At MAYFAIR AESTHETICS we have a 'no double dip' policy that ensures our therapists are using a clean disposable spatula for each application of wax during your service. In addition to our policies on double dipping, we never recycle wax (the process of reheating used wax and sifting out the hair), our therapists wear gloves during all services, we line our waxing tables with clean disposable sheeting for each guest, and of course, disinfect all metal instruments (such as tweezers) between guests. For strip waxing we utilise single use, fully disposable cartridges for every client. For your hygiene, we do not clean rollers and reuse like many other salons.When you walk into a wax room at MAYFAIR AESTHETICS & BEAUTY you enter a clean, fresh, sanitary environment and can relax knowing that your wax services are being provided with the highest level of hygiene and skill so you can enjoy the very best wax experience.UPDATE :We now offer exclusive home services on demand.Kindly send us a message with your needs tomayfairwaxing@icloud.com.Opening Times:Monday : 11.00am–8pmTuesday\t: 11.00am–8pmWednesday : 11.00am–8pmThursday : 11.00am–8pmFriday : 11.00am–8pmSaturday : ClosedSunday : ClosedMayfair Aesthetics & Beauty5 Dering StMayfairLondon W1S 1AA020 7495 2666075 5766 9000info@mayfairaestheticsandbeauty.comINSTAGRAMweb design & build by Oappso""]"

In the 16th century, as printing techniques advanced and new plants came to Europe, wealthy individuals and botanic gardens began to commission artists to record them.Botanical art\xa0has since become\xa0vital for scientific records,\xa0because it can reveal more detail than a photograph.For 30\xa0years Dr Shirley Sherwood has been collecting contemporary botanical illustrations to champion their scientific and aesthetic merit.Since 1990,\xa0her\xa0collection has grown into a comprehensive catalogue of over 1,000 paintings and drawings by more than 300 artists living in 36 countries around the world.Now displayed alongside classic botanical art,\xa0Sherwood’s\xa0incredible collection charts the emergence of a new wave of botanical painting\xa0–\xa0a renaissance in scientific art.Discover more botanical art at KewKew GardensMarianne North GalleryDiscover the colourful vision of the pioneering botanical artist Marianne North.Explore the Marianne North GalleryKew GardensHow to be a botanical artistLearn what it takes to develop your craft as a botanical artist.How to be a botanical artistKew ScienceBotanical jewelleryNew acquisitions of botanical jewellery in Kew’s Economic Botany Collection illustrate how plant parts can be transformed into fascinating cultural objects.Botanical jewelleryDid you know?Facebook pageFacebookTwitter pageTwitterInstagram pageInstagramYouTube pageYouTubeFooterAbout usJobs and volunteeringHire a venuePress and mediaCommercial servicesGrow WildAccessibilityKew GardensOpen today10am–7pm (last entry 6pm)Kew, Richmond, London, TW9 3AE020 8332 5655info@kew.orgTicketsMembershipWakehurstOpen today10am–6pm (last entry 4.30pm)Ardingly, Haywards Heath, Sussex, RH17 6TN01444 894066wakehurst@kew.orgTicketsMembershipStay in touchGet exclusive updates, offers and more in our monthly newsletter.Enter email addressSubmitTerms and conditionsPrivacy policyCookiesModern slavery statement© Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew""]"

Although we would LOVE to go back to normal, we feel that the time is not right for the cinema to relax any of our precautions. We are a small team, and in order to keep the cinema open,  operating and safe, we will be continuing with the steps below.What we’re doing:Auditorium and bar seating will remain socially distanced.Our queuing system will remain in place.Sanitiser stations will continue to be available.Additional cleaning routines will remain in place.What we’re asking of you:Masks should still be worn in the bar and screens unless you’re eating, drinking or exempt.When enjoying a drink in the bar, please remain seated wherever possible.Additionally we are due to have a brand new top-of-the range air conditioning system installed within the next couple of weeks.It’s going to be amazing!We really appreciate the support that everyone has shown us by respecting these precautions since we re-opened. We will continue to monitor the situation, and will only begin to reduce them once we feel that it is safe to do so.Spotlight: SweatPink is the new green There is sweat, there is blood and there are tears. The latest movie of Magnus von Horn is more organic than it seems and behind the pink aesthetic there is emotional and physical violence which is always barely visible. These phenomena of invisibilisation are just markers of our time.\nSweat captures, in a very clever way, how social media exacerbates the failings of our capitalist and sexist society.CharlineCharline30 June 2021•2 min readIntroducing relaxed autism-friendly screeningsWe’re very excited to announce the introduction of relaxed autism-friendly screenings.\nThese offer a chance to see films in a relaxed environment, starting with In The Heights on Sunday 8th Aug @ 11am!

It can also be used all year round on all hair and skin types.Soprano ICE cools the skin with an encircled sapphire tip, preventing surface burns while maintaining heat within the dermis. This high fluency delivery system provides an even more comfortable and faster treatment with improved results for light coloured and thin hair. A lighter and improved ergonomic design also means Soprano ICE is now even easier to use and can be used to treat smaller and difficult to target areas like the eyebrows, nose and ears. Soprano ICE – Cooler, Lighter, SmootherCooler treatmentThe new ICE applicator cools the skin by integrating numerous cooling pumps within the applicator. Combined with the sapphire tip for contact cooling, treatments are more enjoyable than ever before.Lighter applicatorThe weight of the ICE applicator has been significantly reduced, making it one of the lightest hair removal applicators on the market. Without compromising on treatment effectiveness or patient safety, the new ICE applicator makes treatments more enjoyable for the practitioner, as well as the patient.Smoother resultsSoprano ICE with SHR technology is clinically proven as having the industry’s highest coverage rate. The In-Motion technique collectively heats up and deactivates all the hair roots within a grid, rather than seeking individual chromosphores at the hair root.CoursesSame day treatmentOfferBuy any3single treatments or more and get the cheapest50%offCourses OfferBuy3or more Courses and get15%offFree ConsultationFace LaserPer TreatmentCurrent OfferCourses of 3Courses of 6Eyebrow£70£29£69£145Earlobes/nose£70£25£60£125Sideburns£80£25£60£125Upper lip£70£29£69£145Chin£70£29£69£145Jawline£90£39£99£195Side face£150£45£119£225Forehead£120£39£99£195Full face£190£79£219£395Neck (front or back)£85£39£99£195Lip/Chin£100£55£149£275Men's LaserPer TreatmentCurrent OfferCourses of 3Courses of 6Half arms£200£75£209£375Full arms£250£99£280£495Underarms£120£55£149£275Shoulder£140£55£149£275Lower back£140£55£149£275Full back£260£135£389£675Back and shoulder£320£175£509£875Chest£160£75£209£375Stomach£210£80£220£400Chest and stomach£260£149£430£745Half legs£260£99£280£495Full legs£320£145£419£725Ladie's LaserPer TreatmentCurrent OfferCourses of 3Courses of 6Underarms£100£45£119£225Half arms£170£65£179£325Full arms£180£89£250£445Nipples£60£35£89£175Lower back£155£49£130£245Full back£200£89£250£445Half Stomach£115£65£179£325Full Stomach£150£125£359£625Navel (stomach line)£60£39£100£195Bikini line£95£55£149£275Brazilian£110£79£220£395Hollywood£140£85£239£425Buttocks£120£75£209£375Lower legs£140£79£220£395Upper legs£195£85£239£425Full leg£250£119£340£595Feet/Toes£70£35£89£175Toes£60£19£40£9554 Charing Cross Road, London, WC2H 0BB* Terms and conditions©2017 SplashSalon - All rights reserved."", ""Products – SPLASH Charing CrossSkip to contentHomeShop onlineSalonsCharing CrossGoodge StreetSohoServicesBeautyHairLaserProductsTeamOfferContact usBooking Number0203 174 2160Book online now!ProductsMoroccanoil set out to create the proper canvas for all hair care and hairstyling.All of Moroccanoil's nutrient-rich, antioxidant infused formulas are made with the highest quality, authentic ingredients.The only salon system that rebuilds broken hair bonds.Whether it's used as a standalone mini-treatment or as insurance for another salon service, Olaplex produces incredibly healthy hair.Your hair provides a first glimpse into your personality, a personal power used to express your identity.Kérastase continues to create bespoke products and treatments that satisfy the simple desire for exceptional hair.A family-owned company committed to the highest quality products and to our customers’ well-being, OPI has long been a leader in the community and within the Professional Beauty Industry.American Crew is more than just a lifestyle brand or a salon supplier.It's a landmark in the history of men's grooming.It's the leading salon brand created for men specifically to meet the needs of stylists.CND is the global leader in professional nail, hand and foot beauty.

Many will say it lasts two weeks, many will say the product has lasted longer.After TreatmentDo not go swimming for 24 hours or have a long soak in the bathDo not use harsh chemicals when cleaningDo not pick or peel the gel off as this damages natural nailsWear protective gloves when gardening, or doing houseworkAvoid harsh and drying soapsDrink plenty of water and eat wellContinue to use Cuticle Oil after treatmentAftercare ProductsLanolin & petrolium oil based products affect the wearability of Gelcolor/CND ShellacMoisture Replenshing LotionHigh Intensity Hand CreamCuticle Oil is essential to look after the natural nail, this will keep the natural nail healthy and nourished ready for the next application.Removal of GelColor At homeWe would advise clients that GelColor/CND Shellac should not use pure acetone as this dehydrates and strips the nail plate of moisture which over time will cause the natural nail to become weak and brittle. Expert touch by OPI contains moisturis-ers and aloe so much kinder when removing GelcolorDo not pull GelColor off as this takes off layers of the natural nail causing them to become weak and damagedOnce removed advise customers to continue using Cuticle Oil. Customers not re-applying gel if their nails are thin/weak/flake/brittle, clients should use Nail Strengthener to keep their nails strong and healthy.Foot AFTERCAREAvoid tight fitting footwear, wear open toe shoes if warm sunnyRegularly treat hard skin on a gradual basisChange socks and tights dailyApply moisturising lotion daily after bathApply talc or special foot powder between the toes to help absorb moistureFoot sprays containing peppermint or circus oil are useful to refresh the feet during the dayPLEASE ENSURE YOU RECEIVE REGULAR, GENUINE PRODUCTS AND PROFESSIONAL MANICURE & PEDICURE AT LEAST EVERY 2-3 WEEKS FOR MAINTENANCE AND GOOD HEALTHY NAIL CARE.Waxing After CareBefore WaxingFirst wax may take a little longer than subsequent waxesYour hair should be the ideal length for waxing to work and to minimise any discomfort, leave it to grow 3 weeks before your wax appointment with usExfoliating is recommended 3 times a week especially before waxing treatmentDo not moisturise on the day of your appointmentLet your wax technician know if you are taking any medication that can affect your waxing results, such as blood thinners, Retin-A or Accutane (or similar products)Wear loose fitting clothesTake a warm shower before waxingThis will help to open the pore for easy hair removal; you will be given wipes to freshen up with anywayYou can be waxed during your period, although you may be a little more sensitive and a waxing could be more painfulRelax during your waxing service, because tense muscles make the area more sensitive.

I enjoyed my visit, staff was friendly and professional.Agnes P, LondonI've been getting my manicure and pedicure done at this place for a while now (almost 3 years I think!) and it says it all. Very good and quick service, professional staff and high standards of hygiene which has always been very important for me.

Prices are reasonable for the area: you get a better result but pay less than in other Canary Wharf salons. All in all, I highly recommend this place.Malika Gorlanova, LondonMy experience with the service here, is second to none. If I have to travel from work (Waterloo) or home (Stoke Newington), I always leave my appointment knowing it was well worth the journey.

Many will say it lasts two weeks, many will say the product has lasted longer.After TreatmentDo not go swimming for 24 hours or have a long soak in the bathDo not use harsh chemicals when cleaningDo not pick or peel the gel off as this damages natural nailsWear protective gloves when gardening, or doing houseworkAvoid harsh and drying soapsDrink plenty of water and eat wellContinue to use Cuticle Oil after treatmentAftercare ProductsLanolin & petrolium oil based products affect the wearability of Gelcolor/CND ShellacMoisture Replenshing LotionHigh Intensity Hand CreamCuticle Oil is essential to look after the natural nail, this will keep the natural nail healthy and nourished ready for the next application.Removal of GelColor At homeWe would advise clients that GelColor/CND Shellac should not use pure acetone as this dehydrates and strips the nail plate of moisture which over time will cause the natural nail to become weak and brittle. Expert touch by OPI contains moisturis-ers and aloe so much kinder when removing GelcolorDo not pull GelColor off as this takes off layers of the natural nail causing them to become weak and damagedOnce removed advise customers to continue using Cuticle Oil. Customers not re-applying gel if their nails are thin/weak/flake/brittle, clients should use Nail Strengthener to keep their nails strong and healthy.Foot AFTERCAREAvoid tight fitting footwear, wear open toe shoes if warm sunnyRegularly treat hard skin on a gradual basisChange socks and tights dailyApply moisturising lotion daily after bathApply talc or special foot powder between the toes to help absorb moistureFoot sprays containing peppermint or circus oil are useful to refresh the feet during the dayPLEASE ENSURE YOU RECEIVE REGULAR, GENUINE PRODUCTS AND PROFESSIONAL MANICURE & PEDICURE AT LEAST EVERY 2-3 WEEKS FOR MAINTENANCE AND GOOD HEALTHY NAIL CARE.Waxing After CareBefore WaxingFirst wax may take a little longer than subsequent waxesYour hair should be the ideal length for waxing to work and to minimise any discomfort, leave it to grow 3 weeks before your wax appointment with usExfoliating is recommended 3 times a week especially before waxing treatmentDo not moisturise on the day of your appointmentLet your wax technician know if you are taking any medication that can affect your waxing results, such as blood thinners, Retin-A or Accutane (or similar products)Wear loose fitting clothesTake a warm shower before waxingThis will help to open the pore for easy hair removal; you will be given wipes to freshen up with anywayYou can be waxed during your period, although you may be a little more sensitive and a waxing could be more painfulRelax during your waxing service, because tense muscles make the area more sensitive. The results normally keep getting better at least until your 4th wax.After Waxing (24 to 48 hours)Avoid all heat treatments including sunbathing, sun beds, steam baths and saunasAvoid swimming in public pools as chlorine may irritate the area that has been waxedDo not apply perfumed soap, body lotion, talcum powder or deodorant to the treated areasUse only lukewarm water for a bath or showerDo not apply make-up to any treated areaTry to avoid touching skin that has been waxedWear loose-fitting clothesAfter waxing use any lotion in the first 24 hoursStart to exfoliate and moisturise your skin 48 hours after you had the treatment done to prevent ingrowing hairsUse antiseptic cream on facial areas until redness subsides.0780990393237th Floor 1 Canada Square, Canary WharfLondon E14 5AAAboutWaxing© 2021 Oki-DokiCookie PolicyWebsite design byForgot password?Remember meYou can login using your social profileProblem with login?', 'Contact - Oki-Doki | Beauty Salon Canary Wharf07809903932HomeServicesAboutPersonal HygieneAftercareLocationsCloseHomeServicesAboutPersonal HygieneAftercareLocationsLogin37th Floor 1 Canada Square, Canary WharfLondon E14 5AA07809903932LocationsHomeLocationsCanary WharfAddress37th Floor1 Canada SquareCanary WharfLondonE14 5AAHow to get to usFrom Canary Wharf DLR Platform: 2 min walkCanary Wharf Jubilee Station: 3 min walkContact usMobile: 07809903932Opening TimesPlease try to arrive 5 mins before appointment timeCheck in at One Canada Square Reception and the Therapist will meet you on the 37th Floor.We are open on Good Friday but closed on Easter Monday.Sunday – Tuesday:By Appointment OnlyWednesday – Friday:10:00am – 7:00pmSaturday:9:00am – 6:00pmMonday Bank Holiday: Closed0780990393237th Floor 1 Canada Square, Canary WharfLondon E14 5AAAboutWaxing© 2021 Oki-DokiCookie PolicyWebsite design byForgot password?Remember meYou can login using your social profileProblem with login?', 'About - Oki-Doki | Canary Wharf Nail Salon07809903932HomeServicesAboutPersonal HygieneAftercareLocationsCloseHomeServicesAboutPersonal HygieneAftercareLocationsLogin37th Floor 1 Canada Square, Canary WharfLondon E14 5AA07809903932AboutHomeAboutservicesA focused selection of services all listed on\xa0our online price list.Brazillian and Hollywood Bikini Line, Arm,\xa0Eyebrow, Upper Lip etc.productsOnly the best, professional products to give you a flawless, long-lasting finish.OPI: OPI Products Inc, Hollywood-based manufacturer of professional quality hand and nail care products is globally recognised as a leader in the professional beauty industry and claims to be the number one brand.

While the Chinese seems to have done a leading role in using this bloodletting technique to treat certain diseases, the Arabs have adopted it as a much-stressed Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW).The Europeans were also doing cupping to treat many diseases.The difference between the Arabs or Muslims and others in doing hijama was not hidden since while believers were more interested to do hijama as the Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW) (without questioning about anything), whilst others\xa0were doing it as a pure medical benefit.The first and top-level benefit of hijama for a believer is the reward he or she will get, both in this world and the hereafter, by following a stressed Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW). \xa0Not only the believers but also anyone can openly observe or experience the benefits that are bestowed on the followers of the commands of Allah (SWT)\xa0and His Prophet (SAW). \xa0On the other hand, when we look at this bloodletting technique from a worldly perspective, we can find hijama has many benefits.It is noted that hijama promotes the flow of energy in the blood. \xa0It removes toxins\xa0and other waste material from the blood Which\xa0helps\xa0a speedy\xa0recovery time from all forms of illnesses. \xa0Hijama is known to prevent many diseases and, therefore, can be considered one of the best preventive measures against many diseases. \xa0Moreover, it is also noted that hijama can help people who are under some magic spell or who are under the influence of some evil beings.Hijama has no side effects as long as performed properly. \xa0It is also worth noting that about 70% diseases or disorders are caused by the failure of blood to circulate properly in the body. \xa0Furthermore, we get sick or our body organs fail to perform healthily when our blood keep circulating loaded with toxins and other impurities. \xa0Unless the toxic waste is removed from the body or from the blood, not only we do not recover fast from a disease but also become easy victim to other diseases or disorder. \xa0Hijama is the best way to remove the toxic waste from the blood stream, and the results will obviously be a healthy and properly functioning body. \xa0We should never forget that this highly useful and recommended Sunnah of the Prophet (SAW) helps us in controlling many diseases such as infections, hypertension, circulatory diseases, pains, infertility, cancer, etc.Benefits of hijama and conditions treatedHijama can help assist relief and improves many things including:\u200b* Headaches* Back pain* Anaemia* Insomnia* Arthritis* Constipation* Skin problems* Weight loss problems* Detoxifies the Body* Purifies the blood* Improves blood circulation* Common cold and flu* Sciatica* Improves memory* Strengthens immune system* Heart burn and indigestion* Cancer* Black magic* Evil eye* Diabetes* Rheumatism & joint inflammation, and much moreHelps to remove any boilMuscle ache\u200bCupping Clinic\u200bContact Us:Upton Lane:0208 470 7999Ruqya Line:07902 714135\u200bMonday -Saturday: 10am - 9pmSunday: 10am - 9pmhijamainlondon@hotmail.com', 'Cupping Clinic - Fertility Points - Hijama in WalthamstowCupping Clinic\u200b\u200bContact us:Upton Lane :\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 0208 470 7999Ruqya in London\xa0:\xa0 07902 714 135\u200b\u200bwww.hijamainlondon.comShareCupping ClinicHomeCharity FundayRuqya In East LondonCupping Clinic E7PricesHijama - CuppingCupping Clinic E7Cupping Clinic - London - E17Cupping Clinic - LondonBenefits of Hijama/CuppingCupping Clinic fertility pointsAfter care planSunnah Days 2020Cupping Clinic E17Xblam Official StockiestXblam IngredientsHistory of Hijama/CuppingHijama TherapistsHijama/Cupping EquipmentHijama TreatmentHijama In IslamConditions We TreatIPL Hair RemovalIPL Price ListHijama CourseRuqyaRuqya ShopRuqya AudiosRuqya SupportRuqya JournalsJinn AshiqJinn possessionRuqya VersesAbout usJobs VacanciesHijama in LondonHijama North LondonHijama in Central LondonContact usLinks PageBook NowGlossaryBlogMoreCupping Clinic - Hijama TherapyHijama Cupping Benefits for InfertilityWomen of all ages will often experience health issues that are specific to them.

However we decided early on that we would only use the best ingredients available to ensure that we offered a honest, reliable and effective solution to psoriasis and eczema suffers. All of our ingredients are of the same high quality as Il Molino Olive Oil.The reason this olive oil makes a difference to your skin is the unusually high amount of chlorophyll, polyphenol and tocopherol present plus the skin nourishing antioxidants and healthy fats which all comes in at an astonishing 699 mg/kg.

Our witch hazel comes in the raw form of the actual tree chippings itself. Our wild crop cultivators of New England only use the trees that are at their optimum harvesting time which gives us a potent witch hazel infusion.We have a very unique system of producing our own witch hazel which involves a gentle infusion at a carefully monitored constant temperature for two days. This gives us our wonderful mineral rich base which is then ready to be infused with the rest of the ingredients.Of course it would be easier to simple purchase ready infused witch hazel but we were unable to find a supplier that could meet our high demands. This meant doing it from scratch ourselves which has been extremely successful and adds to the uniqueness and effectiveness of the\xa0Xbalm.CalendulaCalendula officinalis (pot marigold) is a golden floral blossom with an impressive list of skin care benefits for Psoriasis and Eczema sufferers. Once we discovered what a difference it made to the original Xbalm we included it into the formula for an even more soothing experience.Anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial:Calendula has healing anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties; in earlier times, it was often use to disinfect wounds, and treat burns and skin infections.Antioxidant rich: Calendula is rich in antioxidants like carotenoids and vitamin A .It’s also very rich in tocopherols (vitamin E), another antioxidant with amazing skin softening abilities.Regenerating: Calendula is effective at reducing the appearance of skin blemishes and many people have reduced the angry appearance of their psoriasis plaques with Calendula ointments. Studies reveal that the extract of this herb blossom can stimulate the production of collagen which is important in proper skin regeneration so for us Psoriasis and Eczema suffers this is excellent news and a vital addition to the XbalmChamomileChamomile is one of the most widely used and well documented medicinal herbs in the world and it dates back thousands of years to Ancient Egypt where it was considered a sacred gift from the Gods.In modern times Chamomile is still thought of as one of the best skincare herbs available and is particularly useful for psoriasis and eczema. This apple-scented herb comes in several different forms, mainly Roman and German Chamomile. We use the Roman Chamomile branch as we seem to get better results with our customers conditions with this variety.Chamomile is a fabulous skincare herb and is suitable for all skin types. As it is so strongly anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiseptic, it is particularly suited to sensitive skins that are prone to inflammation. It is herbs like chamomile that demonstrate why botanical extracts are generally the best choice for your skin.Chamomile is also considered to be hypoallergenic with the ability to neutralise skin irritants and is a perfect addition to our Xbalm. We use one of the highest quality extracts in the world in our formula and you will feel the difference.ChickweedChickweed (Stellaria media ) is a member of the carnation, family and its genus name 'Stellaria' refers to chickweeds tiny, white, star-shaped flowers.Chickweed is a European native that is grown throughout the world in fertile, mineral-rich soil and is a powerhouse of a herb. Rich in minerals and vitamins, including copper, iron and vitamins A, B, and C it is an essential ingredient in the Xbalm.Our chickweed is grown to the highest environmental standards in the United kingdom with plenty of fresh country air and it is some of the finest quality chickweed in the world.Medically, Chickweed has been used for centuries and it's beneficial properties have been known to treat rheumatic pain and even to treat boils and abscesses. Chickweed has well known wound healing properties which speeds the healing of cuts, wounds and has a soothing anti-inflammatory effect when it comes to the symptoms associated with psoriasis and eczema such as itching and skin irritation. Many brands will offer chickweed ointments on their own however with our unique formula we have managed to combine chickweed along with the best of all the anti-inflammatory and anti-itch ingredients. No skin balm will deliver the same results as the Xbalm.Vitamin E oilWe only use the highest grade and purest vitamin e oil available and it is an extremely rich source of tocopherol. This intensely moisturising Vitamin E oil is a powerful antioxidant which assists and helps regenerate and nourish the skin affected by psoriasis and eczema. It is also known to help the skin retain its natural moisture and eliminate dryness.Petroleum JellyDermatologists around the world continue to advise people of all ages to include a high grade petroleum jelly into their skin care routines and it's considered by experts to still be one of the most effective treatments for eczema and psoriasis. It's also still used to relieve diaper rash, heal raw noses and soothe chapped lips amongst other things.

The effect has remained the same; only the cups and the techniques have changed over these many years. We can find the\xa0application\xa0of suction cups in the medicine of all “Primitive” people, as well as in the oldest civilizations. Reports about the art of cupping were already to be found in ancient Chinese and Egyptian medical scriptures.\u200bCupping therapy is also referred to as hijama.

The hair transmits this heat into the follicle, which is then destroyed and rendered which makes it unable to produce a new hair.What is IPL ?IPL is used for Unwanted hair removal i whichs mainly \x03considered a cosmetic treatment but may very well be the result of medical conditions. For women hair, removal is often requested in the face, arm, legs and underarms whereas for men hair removal on the cheek, chest, and back is in higher demand.How does the Ellipse SWT/ laser hair removal treatment work?To achieve long lasting or permanent hair removal, it is \x03necessary to destroy the hair follicle from which individual hairs grow. Controlled pulses of light penetrate the epidermis and are absorbed by melanin in the hair contained in the follicle.\u200bMelanin converts the light energy into heat. This heat is transferred to the hair follicle, which is destroyed, making it unable to produce a new hair. Hair in the resting \x03(telogen stage) are treated later. The treatment is only \x03effective on growing hairs as these are still attached to the \x03follicle. This technique is called “Selective Photothermolysis”.\u200bThe visible light produced by Ellipse I²PL systems is carefully controlled to ensure the correct pulse length, wavelengths and right amount of energy to destroy the follicle.AdvantagesWith Ellipse SWT® systems you get the fastest hair removal treatments on the market applicable for skin type I -VI. The visible light produced by Ellipse SWT® systems is carefully controlled to ensure the correct pulse length, wavelengths and right amount of energy to destroy the follicle.\u200bEllipse Selective Waveband Technology (SWT®) hair removal treatment offers clinically-proven, safe and effective long-term removal of unwanted hair. Excellent hair clearance is obtained after only 4-6 SWT® treatments and clinical long term studies have proven that 77% hair is still away after 10 years.Cupping Clinic\u200bContact Us:Upton Lane:0208 470 7999Ruqya Line:07902 714135\u200bMonday -Saturday: 10am - 9pmSunday: 10am - 9pmhijamainlondon@hotmail.com', 'Laser Hair Removal | IPL Hair Removal Price list - Clinic in WalthamstCupping Clinic\u200b\u200bContact us:Upton Lane :\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 0208 470 7999Ruqya in London\xa0:\xa0 07902 714 135\u200b\u200bwww.hijamainlondon.comShareCupping ClinicHomeCharity FundayRuqya In East LondonCupping Clinic E7PricesHijama - CuppingCupping Clinic E7Cupping Clinic - London - E17Cupping Clinic - LondonBenefits of Hijama/CuppingCupping Clinic fertility pointsAfter care planSunnah Days 2020Cupping Clinic E17Xblam Official StockiestXblam IngredientsHistory of Hijama/CuppingHijama TherapistsHijama/Cupping EquipmentHijama TreatmentHijama In IslamConditions We TreatIPL Hair RemovalIPL Price ListHijama CourseRuqyaRuqya ShopRuqya AudiosRuqya SupportRuqya JournalsJinn AshiqJinn possessionRuqya VersesAbout usJobs VacanciesHijama in LondonHijama North LondonHijama in Central LondonContact usLinks PageBook NowGlossaryBlogMoreIPL Laser Treatment Price listSpecialoffer Laser IPL TreatmentPay for 5 sessions and receive your 6th session free!On selected packages onlyLaser Ipl treatment Free consultationFree Patch TestWhere To Find us for Laser Treatment, IPL TreatmentBlue Leaf Cupping Clinic\u200b312 Hoe StWalthamstowLondonE17 9PXCupping Clinic\u200bContact Us:Upton Lane:0208 470 7999Ruqya Line:07902 714135\u200bMonday -Saturday: 10am - 9pmSunday: 10am - 9pmhijamainlondon@hotmail.com', ""Hijama courses in LondonCupping Clinic\u200b\u200bContact us:Upton Lane :\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 0208 470 7999Ruqya in London\xa0:\xa0 07902 714 135\u200b\u200bwww.hijamainlondon.comShareCupping ClinicHomeCharity FundayRuqya In East LondonCupping Clinic E7PricesHijama - CuppingCupping Clinic E7Cupping Clinic - London - E17Cupping Clinic - LondonBenefits of Hijama/CuppingCupping Clinic fertility pointsAfter care planSunnah Days 2020Cupping Clinic E17Xblam Official StockiestXblam IngredientsHistory of Hijama/CuppingHijama TherapistsHijama/Cupping EquipmentHijama TreatmentHijama In IslamConditions We TreatIPL Hair RemovalIPL Price ListHijama CourseRuqyaRuqya ShopRuqya AudiosRuqya SupportRuqya JournalsJinn AshiqJinn possessionRuqya VersesAbout usJobs VacanciesHijama in LondonHijama North LondonHijama in Central LondonContact usLinks PageBook NowGlossaryBlogMoreHijama\xa0courses in London\u200bCupping/Hijama Course datesJoin Our Academy To Have a chance to work in one of our clinics - we give priority to the students we have trained.\u200bDue to Covid, all theories of the course will take place online\u200bpractical will take place in small groups in the clinic\u200bCourse dates:\u200bAugust 2021\u200bMonday 16th August Online Hijama course\xa0 6pm - 9pmTuesday 17th August 7pm - 9pm\u200bthe practical date will be set after the theory is completed\u200bPrice ** £500** per person\u200bcontact details: 07515313518If You're Looking for a clinical internship at our clinic\xa0 ( Subject to an additional cost )We currently have some spaces for internships possible placements after successfully completing training at our clinic( We Currently Have male placement possible career at our cupping clinic )Course informationDay 1Students will be studying the theory which will be covering the following modules:Module 1: What is Cupping/Hijama?1.

All of which are used as a means of treatment for a person suffering from evil eye, envy, possession, sihr and other illnesses such as fever etc.Types of RuqyaRuqya is two types types:1. Ruqya ash-Shariyyah2. Ruqya ash-ShirkiyahRuqya ash-Shariyyah:This Ruqya that is free from shirk and involves the recitation of Qur’an, seeking assistance and refuge in Allah alone as mentioned above. Ruqya ash-Shariyyah meets 3 conditions. And it is from the consensus of the scholars that the legalisation of Ruqya is achieved when 3 conditions are met:1. It must be with the words of Allah (Qur’an), his names and his attributes.2. It must be in the Arabic language or a language that is understood.3. To believe Ruqya has no benefit by itself, but the benefits and cure are from Allah.(These conditions can be found in ‘fath al-Bari’ and the saying of ‘Ibn taymiyyah’ concerning healing the one who’s possessed.)Therefore, Ruqya ash-Shariyyah is permissible and legal in Islam as the Prophet (SAW) himself performed this type of Ruqya and commanded others to do so.Narrated by Muslim: ‘Awf Bin Malik al-Ashja’i (RA) narrated that he said to the Prophet (Peace and Blessing upon Him), “O Allah’s Messenger! We used to apply ruqya during Jahiliyyah. What do you think of that?” He (Peace and Blessing upon Him) replied: ‘Present your ruqya to me. There is nothing wrong with it as long as they do not involve shirk.’There are two types of ruqya: ruqya which is prescribed in the Qur’an and the prophetic narration, and the second which is shirk.\u200bRuqya ash-ShirkiyahRuqya ash-Shirkiyah: This type of ruqya leads to sin and destruction upon the individual as it involves calling upon other than Allah with assistance sought from jinn, magicians, horoscopes (moon and stars) and charms & amulets etc. Therefore Ruqya ash-Shirkiyah contains shirk/associating partners with Allah, making its practice completely forbidden in Islam, which is evident from the above hadeeth of the Prophet (SAW).\u200b\u200b\u200bThe scholars mention that Ruqya is not a practice that is only performed by a particular individual, rather any individual can perform Ruqya to themselves and to others. It is also possible that a man can do Ruqya to a woman and a wife can do Ruqya to her husband and there is no doubt that piety brings goodness. Allah (SWT) says in the Quran:“Verily Allah accepts from the Muttaqeen” (Al-Ma’edah:27)There was a debate about those who read Qur’an to treat people with ruqya. Some people said that it is not permissible for ordinary people to use the Qur’an to treat people with ruqya; this should only be done by those who are well-versed in knowledge of sharee’ah. Others say that it is sufficient for the one who wants to use ruqya to have memorized the Book of Allah, to have a sound belief, to be righteous and to have taqwa.The correct view is that it is permissible for every reader who can recite the Qur’an well and who understands its meanings, has a sound belief, does righteous deeds and is of upright conduct to use ruqya. It is not essential for him to have knowledge of minor matters or to have studied all branches of knowledge in depth. This is because of the story of Abu Sa’eed and the man who had been stung by a scorpion, “… and we did not know that he ever did ruqya before that incident”, as is stated in the hadith. (Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2276; Muslim, 2201). The raaqi must have a good intention and want to benefit the Muslim; he should not be concerned with money or payment, so that his reading will be more beneficial.And Allah knows best.From Al-Lu’lu’ al-Makeen min Fataawaa Ibn Jibreen, p. 22.Who Can Perform Ruqya?Cupping Clinic\u200bContact Us:Upton Lane:0208 470 7999Ruqya Line:07902 714135\u200bMonday -Saturday: 10am - 9pmSunday: 10am - 9pmhijamainlondon@hotmail.com', ""Ruqya Shop with sunnah productsCupping Clinic\u200b\u200bContact us:Upton Lane :\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 0208 470 7999Ruqya in London\xa0:\xa0 07902 714 135\u200b\u200bwww.hijamainlondon.comShareCupping ClinicHomeCharity FundayRuqya In East LondonCupping Clinic E7PricesHijama - CuppingCupping Clinic E7Cupping Clinic - London - E17Cupping Clinic - LondonBenefits of Hijama/CuppingCupping Clinic fertility pointsAfter care planSunnah Days 2020Cupping Clinic E17Xblam Official StockiestXblam IngredientsHistory of Hijama/CuppingHijama TherapistsHijama/Cupping EquipmentHijama TreatmentHijama In IslamConditions We TreatIPL Hair RemovalIPL Price ListHijama CourseRuqyaRuqya ShopRuqya AudiosRuqya SupportRuqya JournalsJinn AshiqJinn possessionRuqya VersesAbout usJobs VacanciesHijama in LondonHijama North LondonHijama in Central LondonContact usLinks PageBook NowGlossaryBlogMoreSunnah ProductsVarious of diffrent\xa0products used as part of a Ruqya Program.Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99SALEQuick ViewI'm a productRegular Price£19.99Sale Price£14.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99SALEQuick ViewI'm a productRegular Price£19.99Sale Price£14.99NewQuick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99SALEQuick ViewI'm a productRegular Price£19.99Sale Price£14.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99NewQuick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Quick ViewI'm a productPrice£19.99Cupping Clinic\u200bContact Us:Upton Lane:0208 470 7999Ruqya Line:07902 714135\u200bMonday -Saturday: 10am - 9pmSunday: 10am - 9pmhijamainlondon@hotmail.com"", ""Ruqya in London - Healing through reciting and listeningCupping Clinic\u200b\u200bContact us:Upton Lane :\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 0208 470 7999Ruqya in London\xa0:\xa0 07902 714 135\u200b\u200bwww.hijamainlondon.comShareCupping ClinicHomeCharity FundayRuqya In East LondonCupping Clinic E7PricesHijama - CuppingCupping Clinic E7Cupping Clinic - London - E17Cupping Clinic - LondonBenefits of Hijama/CuppingCupping Clinic fertility pointsAfter care planSunnah Days 2020Cupping Clinic E17Xblam Official StockiestXblam IngredientsHistory of Hijama/CuppingHijama TherapistsHijama/Cupping EquipmentHijama TreatmentHijama In IslamConditions We TreatIPL Hair RemovalIPL Price ListHijama CourseRuqyaRuqya ShopRuqya AudiosRuqya SupportRuqya JournalsJinn AshiqJinn possessionRuqya VersesAbout usJobs VacanciesHijama in LondonHijama North LondonHijama in Central LondonContact usLinks PageBook NowGlossaryBlogMoreRuqya inlondonRuqya AudiosRuqya Service from the Quran and Sunnah For Shir, Ayn And Jinn possessionContactus:07902 7141351.

All of which are used as a means of treatment for a person suffering from evil eye, envy, possession, sihr and other illnesses such as fever etc. it is also a protection for Muslims against shirk which is associating partners with Allah (swt). This helps to increase (imaan) which is faith and taqwah which is piety . It is also form of Dawa e.g inviting non muslims to islam and a nasiah to muslim to turn back to Allah swt.Verily Allah swt saysQuran 17:81And say, “Truth has come, and falsehood has departed. Indeed is falsehood, [by nature], ever bound to depart.”Quran Yunus10:12And when affliction touches man, he calls upon Us, whether lying on his side or sitting or standing; but when We remove from him his affliction, he continues [in disobedience] as if he had never called upon Us to [remove] an affliction that touched him. Thus is made pleasing to the transgressors that which they have been doingWe need to remind our self\xa0 by looking following hadith ayats below:Abu Sa’id and Abu Hurairah (May Allah be pleased with him) reported that the Prophet (ﷺ) said:“Never a believer is stricken with a discomfort, an illness, an anxiety, a grief or mental worry or even the pricking of a thorn but Allah will expiate his sins on account of his patience”.[Al-Bukhari and Muslim].Quran 94:6Indeed, with hardship [will be] ease.2:286Allah does not charge a soul except [with that within] its capacityAllah swt Also says that the plot of saytan is weakNisa 4:76Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah , and those who disbelieve fight in the cause of Taghut. So fight against the allies of Satan. Indeed, the plot of Satan has ever been weak.\u200bPrevention\xa0of seeking the Cure1.

However, if only the jinn is doing this out of their will it is oppression.The one who is committing this crime must be informed of there actions and they will be judged according to Allah and His messenger’s laws which were sent for man and jinn.Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said taking pleasure in something or someone is to get what they want from the person or thing as what they wish or desire. This falls under all types of pleasure. The jinn will bring a thing for them to please man, an image or money, take revenge on someone through murder, and in return, they require a man to obey the jinn by making them do acts of shirk, such as sujood to the jinn or another object or taking pleasure in them.And [mention, O Muhammad], the Day when He will gather them together [and say], “O company of jinn, you have [misled] many of mankind.” And their allies among mankind will say, “Our Lord, some of us made use of others, and we have [now] reached our term, which you appointed for us.” He will say, “The Fire is your residence, wherein you will abide eternally, except for what Allah wills. Indeed, your Lord is Wise and Knowing.”1. SihrThe jinn accompanies the one who has been bewitched to accomplish his goal. A person who visits a Saahir can be possessed.2. ‘AynA Shaytaan will enter a person's body through the channel of the evil eye, from the nafs of the one who has given the eye. The Shaytaan will see this channel from the person who gives the evil eye, through jealousy or envy, and will enter the person’s body through this channel.3. ZaarZaar is a trance ceremony that uses drumming and dancing to cure an illness thought to be caused by a demon, it is prohibited by Islam as a pagan practice.The participants will form a circle and dance until they start losing control of their bodies and the jinn will enter them. Even if one is not taking part, but is present they can be possessed because they are not in a gathering of the remembrance of Allah azza wa jal, but a gathering of the remembrance of Shaytaan.In most places that are gatherings of Shaytaan, the possibility arises for a person to be possessed. I have had an experiences where patients have been raving, staying out late, listening to loud music, dancing, taking drugs and drinking alcohol and all types of Al Munkar and Al Fahsha’ will be there, and so this is a time when the Shayateen will be there and they will possess a human being.Shaykh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said there is time that a person who has been possessed out of love, this type is less difficult as others, such as revenge by possession, or by pouring hot water or killing them without knowing, and this is the most difficult type of possession.What this means, Allahu Alim, is that the possession of a jinn who is taking a revenge is different to the one who possesses for love, they are not trying to kill them, they just want to be with them, even though they can cause them a lot of harm by making them ill, or not appear nice. These are tricks the jinn do so that the person is just theirs, but when it is revenge they are trying to kill the individual.And Allah knows best.Treatment of a Patient with a Jinn Aashiq:he oppression of the jinn begins the moment the person starts to fight against the jinn’s desires. For example, if the jinn desires to smoke, and the person who never smokes begins smoking, or the person begins to watch inappropriate materials on TV or the internet, as soon as the person questions what they are doing and tries to stop doing what is wrong, the jinn will try to punish them.During the ruqya, the jinn will usually speak and say that they love the person they have possessed, and refuse to leave the person. This is the typical behavior of a lustful jinn. It is very important for a raaqi to pay very close attention to what type of jinn they are dealing with, while he is reciting on someone in such a state, because there are different types of jinn and they have different strengths and characteristics, for example, the afreet jinn will not speak at all, while others will speak straight away.Shaykh Islam Ibn Taymiyyah said in ‘Majmu al Fatawah’, if the reason of possession is through fawahish – all form sexual desires and disobedience to Allah azza wa jal – touching, seeing, walking towards, to have evil intent concerning sexual desires – it is very important for the raaqi to tell the jinn that this is haraam, and Allah azza wa jal has made this haraam on mankind and jinn. The raaqi is then to deal with them appropriately according to the Qur’an and Sunnah.When the raaqi is trying to convince the jinn to leave the body, the jinn often refuses, although sometimes they may become Muslim yet still stay with them. Some will not become Muslim because they know that if they become Muslim they will have to obey the commands of Allah and his messenger which in turn will mean they will have to leave and stop being with them sexually, as this is a form of oppression. It is very difficult to help someone who is far away from Allah (swt), since they are confused can start fantasizing and believe that they are in a romantic story, and are not aware of the reality of life.Ways to take precaution to stop a jinn having sexual intercourse with the patient• Use Musk al Aswad, or olive oil that has been recited up on the private areas of the patient, every night before they go to sleep.• Use good scents on their clothing, e.g. Musk al Aswad or Musk al Abyad.• Sleep in clothing that covers the entire body, i.e. to the wrists and ankles.• When undressing to say bismillah la illah ila hu. While removing clothing recite ‘Bismillah” as the devil gets blinded and can’t look at the private parts due to this. Another hadith reports that one should say bismillah la ila ha illahu.• 1 At-Tirmithi 2/505, among others. See ‘Irwa’ul Ghalil no. 49 and Sahihul-Jami’ 3/203O children of Adam, let not Satan tempt you as he removed your parents from Paradise, stripping them of their clothing to show them their private parts. Indeed, he sees you, he and his tribe, from where you do not see them. Indeed, We have made the devils allies to those who do not believe. (Surah A’raf: 27)• To recite the morning and evening Adhkaar.• To pray on time.• The patient should not sleep alone.• The patient should seek refuge and protection in Allah from the Shaytaan and sincerely believeAllah to be sufficient for them.It is important not to confuse the jinn with Shaytaan, Iblees, who lives on the sea. His troops and followers are the ones who are widespread over the earth. The jinn is everywhere, in the market places, in the homes, in the bathrooms, etc.Anas ibn Maalik narrated that when the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) ate, he would lick his three fingers, “And he said, ‘If anyone of you drops a piece of food, let him remove any dirt from it and eat it, and not leave it for the Shaytaan.’ And he commanded us to clean the plate, and said, ‘For you do not know where in your food the blessing is.’” (Narrated by Muslim, 2034).Sexual intercourse between human and jinnSexual intercourse between a human and a jinn can happen in one of the following ways;• The person has a wet dream.• Masturbation.• Seeing a form who they will sleep with, with this they can have children.• A person doesn’t have a wet dream but feels as though someone is having sexual intercourse with them.The jinn will come to a man or woman in the image they desire, and by doing so will take pleasure by fulfilling their sexual desire.The marriage of jinn and humansShaykh Islam Ibn Taymiyyah says in ‘Majmu’ al-Fatawa’ – if a human being loves a jinn and there is a mutual agreement they can have children. This is something that is well known. Bilqis, the Queen of Saba, one of her fathers were from the jinn. This can be found in Luq Al marjaan.On occasion, the jinn will say that they want to marry the person they are in love with, in which case it is vital to show the jinn that this concept is absurd since the person cannot see the jinn that is asking for marriage. Even if they were to take a form where the person could see them, it is still forbidden. The evidence is in the Qur'an, where Allah (SWT) says;“And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates that you may find tranquillity in them, and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed in that are signs for a people who give thought”. (Surah Ar Rum: 21)Allah (SWT) says here that He created from ‘yourselves’ i.e. for jinn from themselves, and from a human from themselves. Therefore a relationship between mankind and jinn would not be from themselves. The jinn should be informed that if they were to leave something for the sake of Allah azza wa jal, He (swt) will give them something better. For example, Allah (SWT) will reward the believers with Hoor al ‘Ayn in Jannah.Most of the cases of jinn possession are due to lustful desire. A person who has been desired does not have to be beautiful.Cupping Clinic\u200bContact Us:Upton Lane:0208 470 7999Ruqya Line:07902 714135\u200bMonday -Saturday: 10am - 9pmSunday: 10am - 9pmhijamainlondon@hotmail.com"", 'Ruqya in London | Jinn PossessionCupping Clinic\u200b\u200bContact us:Upton Lane :\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 0208 470 7999Ruqya in London\xa0:\xa0 07902 714 135\u200b\u200bwww.hijamainlondon.comShareCupping ClinicHomeCharity FundayRuqya In East LondonCupping Clinic E7PricesHijama - CuppingCupping Clinic E7Cupping Clinic - London - E17Cupping Clinic - LondonBenefits of Hijama/CuppingCupping Clinic fertility pointsAfter care planSunnah Days 2020Cupping Clinic E17Xblam Official StockiestXblam IngredientsHistory of Hijama/CuppingHijama TherapistsHijama/Cupping EquipmentHijama TreatmentHijama In IslamConditions We TreatIPL Hair RemovalIPL Price ListHijama CourseRuqyaRuqya ShopRuqya AudiosRuqya SupportRuqya JournalsJinn AshiqJinn possessionRuqya VersesAbout usJobs VacanciesHijama in LondonHijama North LondonHijama in Central LondonContact usLinks PageBook NowGlossaryBlogMoreJinnPossessionRuqya Service from the Quran and Sunnah For Shir, Ayn And Jinn possessionContactus:07902 714135Jinn possession of a human is proven in the Qur’an and Sunnah, and by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah and by the eyewitness. No one disputes this apart from the Mu’tazilah who give priority to their own rational analysis over the evidence of the Qur’aan and Sunnah.“Those who eat Ribaa will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only like Ribaa’…” [Al-Baqarah 2:275]\u200bAl-Qurtubi said in his Tafseer (part 3, p. 355): “This ayah is proof that those people are wrong who deny that epilepsy is caused by the jinn and claim that its causes are only physical and that the Shaytaan does not enter people or cause madness.”Ibn Katheer said in his Tafseer (part 1, p. 32), after mentioning the ayah quoted above: “They will not rise from their graves on the Day of Resurrection except like the way in which the epileptic rises during his seizure when he is beaten by the Shaytaan. This is because they will rise in a very bad state. Ibn ‘Abbaas said: the one who consumes riba will rise on the Day of Resurrection crazy and choking.”Ibn Taymiyah (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 42/276) said: “The fact that jinn can enter human bodies is proven by the consensus of Ahl al-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa’ah. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): ‘those who eat Riba will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaytaan (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: ‘Trading is only like Ribaa’…’ [Al-Baqarah 2:275]. And in as-Saheeh it is narrated that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘The Shaytaan flows through the son of Adam as the blood flows through his veins.’”\u200b‘Abd-Allaah ibn al-Imaam Ahmad ibn Hanbal said; “I said to my father, ‘There are some people who say that the jinn do not enter the body of the epileptic.’ He said: ‘O my son, they are lying; the jinn could speak through this person.’” Commenting on this, Ibn Qudaamah said: “What he said is well known, because a person may suffer an epileptic seizure and speak in a language that no one understands, and his body may be beaten with blows that would fell a camel, but the epileptic does not feel them at all, and he is also unaware of the words he is saying. The epileptic and others may be dragged about, or the carpet on which he is sitting may be pulled, and utensils may be moved about from place to place, and other things may happen. Anyone who witnesses such a thing will know for sure that the one who is speaking through the person and moving these things is not human.” And he said may Allaah have mercy on him: “There is no one among the imams of the Muslims who denies that jinn may enter the body of the epileptic and others. Anyone who denies that and claims that Islam denies it is lying about Islam. There is nothing in the proofs of sharee’ah to show that it does not happen.”Reason for demonic Jinn Possession1. RevengeWhen a jinn possesses a human being for revenge, it is usually because the human has caused harm to it, or the jinn thinks the person has intentionally caused it harm.The ways in which a human can cause harm to the jinnWhen the jinn possesses a human for revenge it usually due to one of the following reasons:i) Pouring boiling water: Boiling water can cause harm to the jinn or even kill them. If a person, for example, pours boiling water in the bathroom or in the lavatory while cleaning and does not say bismillah before they pour water, a jinn could be sleeping there, perhaps a baby, or a young jinn and they will be killed or harmed, and the family or tribe of the jinn will want to take revenge.ii) Urinating in places where jinn resides: The jinn resides in places where human beings do not frequently visit and tend to take control of these areas and make them their homes. For example, insect holes, caves or woodlands.If a jinn is sleeping or sitting with his family by a bush for example, and a human comes and urinates there, where the jinn resides, and he doesn’t say bismillah beforehand, the jinn can take control of him, since they feel that he has caused them harm, so the effect will be that they will cause him to harm in return. I have personally seen this happen where a brother came to me, I read ruqya for him, and the jinn had explained that he had taken control of this person because of his actions in a park.iii) Harming animals that have jinn in them: Jinn can take the form of animals/Jinn can live in animals, particularly black animals, and so if a person harms an animal, particularly at night, these can be jinn and they can harm you back. Shaykh al-Islam, Ibn Taymiyyah, said: The jinn may appear in human and animal form, so they may appear as snakes and scorpions, etc., or in the form of camels, cattle, sheep, horses, mules, and donkeys, or in the form of birds, or in the form of humans, as the Shaytaan came to Quraysh in the form of Suraaqah ibn Maalik ibn Ju’sham when they wanted to set out for Badr. (Majmoo’ al-Fataawa, 19/44.)According to the Prophet ﷺ, if a snake enters your home, it may be a jinn, and so you must give it the time and option to leave, for 3 days and if it still refuses then kill it as it is Shaytaan.Cupping Clinic\u200bContact Us:Upton Lane:0208 470 7999Ruqya Line:07902 714135\u200bMonday -Saturday: 10am - 9pmSunday: 10am - 9pmhijamainlondon@hotmail.com', 'Ruqya Verses |

Enter Sir William Withey Gull, the Royal physician who was serving Queen Victoria and Albert, the Prince of Wales. William’s laboratory was in the basement of our Mayfair shop, and you can go there today to experience our Royal Ripper treatment. With his freemasonry connections and his allegiance to the Prince, Sir William is often thought to be a suspect or an accomplice for the 1888 terror of East London.

It seemed fitting for Master Barber and Founder, Halil Ismail, to pay homage to the oddity of Jack and form a brand around his successful Turkish barbering business.Our store at No.4 Toynbee Street has become a landmark within\xa0Spitalfields\xa0not only for its great cuts and shave but also as a tourist attraction for many who take part in the ripper tour.Jack is the grandson of the Ripper. Now he’s\xa0back in town (a new man so to speak) and his main priority is to keep all the gentlemen of London looking trim and proppa.We all learnt our trade from a young age watching our Fathers and practicing on relatives. That’s right, they took the “cuts” so you don’t have to!The master barbers you see in our shops today all follow the code of craftsmanship that Jack carved into his ethos.Why Us?THE STORYEmerging from the mist of his murky heritage, Jack charmed and chopped his way to the throne at the table of London’s elite barbers. But this was not without great struggle. Jack is the grandson and the last remaining blood relation of the city’s most elusive and enduring character – Jack the Ripper, the infamously cold and calculated serial killer who haunted the east end of Victoria London and evaded any repercussions.Our Jack never spoke much, it was said of him that he let his blade do the talking; that he made great symphonies with his scissors and poems with his perms. Jack is an artist and like all memorable artists, they leave legacy through their work and live eternally through it. The Master barbers you see in our shops today all follow the code of the craftsmanship that Jack carved into his ethos.Digging into the family archives revealed some hair-raising truths about Jack. We now know that the Ripper was a freemason, a member of a powerful elite which ruled over England and shaped society how it saw fit.The Ripper’s acts of murder were sacrificial rituals and he got away with it because Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline was a member of the same fraternity.Our Jack decided that he wanted to steer his family’s tradition away from barbarism and towards barbership. Perhaps it was a feeling of remorse or a desire to repent for his grandfather’s brutality but the only thing Jack was passionate about executing was excellence. So, Jack the Clipper was formed in the mid-20th century as a brotherhood, an exclusive club for the top brass and the most pristine gentlemen of the Paris and beyond.Freemasonry isn’t the kind of faction you can exit with ease, so we know that Jack frequented the organisation and would rendezvous regularly with his fellows. The blades he used to sharpen beards belonged to his grandfather, and are still in use today but reserved only for the lucky recipients of the Royal Ripper; such is the prestige and the history behind them.Brand Awareness & CollaborationAwardsAppointments available in all storesBook an appointmentBow Lane47 Bow Lane, London, EC4M 9DLWeekdays: 9am-8pm Sat: 9am-6pm Sun: ClosedT: 020 8616 3708Brick Lane178b Brick Lane , London, E1 6SAWeekdays: 9am-8pm Sat: 9am-6pm Sun: 10am-6pmT: 020 3774 2528Mayfair5 Shepherd Market, London, W1J 7PDWeekdays: 9am-8pm Sat: 9am-6pm Sun: 10am-6pmT: 020 3602 2427Spitalfields4 Toynbee Street, London, E1 7NEWeekdays: 9am-8pm Sat: 9am-6pm Sun: 10am-6pmT: 020 7247 1524Canary WharfRP 250, Cabot Place, London, E14 4QSWeekdays: 10-8, Sat: 10-7, Sun: 11.30-6T: 020 3040 0123©2021 Jack The Clipper · Built byKlinicalT&CSPrivacy PolicyContact UsCLOSEThis is our presidential service packed with charm and chimes for the most prestigious gentlemen.

This shop is at the heart of Jack’s story; the roots of his family tree are reddened here with a bloody stain which this part of London is still recovering from.Appointments available in all storesBook an appointmentBow Lane47 Bow Lane, London, EC4M 9DLWeekdays: 9am-8pm Sat: 9am-6pm Sun: ClosedT: 020 8616 3708Brick Lane178b Brick Lane , London, E1 6SAWeekdays: 9am-8pm Sat: 9am-6pm Sun: 10am-6pmT: 020 3774 2528Mayfair5 Shepherd Market, London, W1J 7PDWeekdays: 9am-8pm Sat: 9am-6pm Sun: 10am-6pmT: 020 3602 2427Spitalfields4 Toynbee Street, London, E1 7NEWeekdays: 9am-8pm Sat: 9am-6pm Sun: 10am-6pmT: 020 7247 1524Canary WharfRP 250, Cabot Place, London, E14 4QSWeekdays: 10-8, Sat: 10-7, Sun: 11.30-6T: 020 3040 0123©2021 Jack The Clipper · Built byKlinicalT&CSPrivacy PolicyContact UsCLOSEThis is our presidential service packed with charm and chimes for the most prestigious gentlemen.

It seemed fitting for Master Barber and Founder, Halil Ismail, to pay homage to the oddity of Jack and form a brand around his successful Turkish barbering business.Our store at No.4 Toynbee Street has become a landmark within\xa0Spitalfields\xa0not only for its great cuts and shave but also as a tourist attraction for many who take part in the ripper tour.Jack is the grandson of the Ripper. Now he’s\xa0back in town (a new man so to speak) and his main priority is to keep all the gentlemen of London looking trim and proppa.We all learnt our trade from a young age watching our Fathers and practicing on relatives. That’s right, they took the “cuts” so you don’t have to!The master barbers you see in our shops today all follow the code of craftsmanship that Jack carved into his ethos.Why Us?THE STORYEmerging from the mist of his murky heritage, Jack charmed and chopped his way to the throne at the table of London’s elite barbers. But this was not without great struggle. Jack is the grandson and the last remaining blood relation of the city’s most elusive and enduring character – Jack the Ripper, the infamously cold and calculated serial killer who haunted the east end of Victoria London and evaded any repercussions.Our Jack never spoke much, it was said of him that he let his blade do the talking; that he made great symphonies with his scissors and poems with his perms. Jack is an artist and like all memorable artists, they leave legacy through their work and live eternally through it. The Master barbers you see in our shops today all follow the code of the craftsmanship that Jack carved into his ethos.Digging into the family archives revealed some hair-raising truths about Jack. We now know that the Ripper was a freemason, a member of a powerful elite which ruled over England and shaped society how it saw fit.The Ripper’s acts of murder were sacrificial rituals and he got away with it because Chief Inspector Frederick Abberline was a member of the same fraternity.Our Jack decided that he wanted to steer his family’s tradition away from barbarism and towards barbership. Perhaps it was a feeling of remorse or a desire to repent for his grandfather’s brutality but the only thing Jack was passionate about executing was excellence. So, Jack the Clipper was formed in the mid-20th century as a brotherhood, an exclusive club for the top brass and the most pristine gentlemen of the Paris and beyond.Freemasonry isn’t the kind of faction you can exit with ease, so we know that Jack frequented the organisation and would rendezvous regularly with his fellows. The blades he used to sharpen beards belonged to his grandfather, and are still in use today but reserved only for the lucky recipients of the Royal Ripper; such is the prestige and the history behind them.Brand Awareness & CollaborationAwardsAppointments available in all storesBook an appointmentBow Lane47 Bow Lane, London, EC4M 9DLWeekdays: 9am-8pm Sat: 9am-6pm Sun: ClosedT: 020 8616 3708Brick Lane178b Brick Lane , London, E1 6SAWeekdays: 9am-8pm Sat: 9am-6pm Sun: 10am-6pmT: 020 3774 2528Mayfair5 Shepherd Market, London, W1J 7PDWeekdays: 9am-8pm Sat: 9am-6pm Sun: 10am-6pmT: 020 3602 2427Spitalfields4 Toynbee Street, London, E1 7NEWeekdays: 9am-8pm Sat: 9am-6pm Sun: 10am-6pmT: 020 7247 1524Canary WharfRP 250, Cabot Place, London, E14 4QSWeekdays: 10-8, Sat: 10-7, Sun: 11.30-6T: 020 3040 0123©2021 Jack The Clipper · Built byKlinicalT&CSPrivacy PolicyContact UsCLOSEThis is our presidential service packed with charm and chimes for the most prestigious gentlemen.

Let Jack trim you to perfection while you sip on a complimentary beverage from our bar. Our craftsmen will take care of your hair, tailoring it to a look which suits you.×', 'Privacy Policy | Jack The ClipperLocationsBow LaneBrick LaneMayfairSpitalfieldsCanary WharfTreatmentsAppointmentsBook An AppointmentJack In The BoxShopStoryWhy UsBlogContactWork With UsJoin Jack’s ClubPromotionsCart£0.000Your cart is empty.LoginSign UpMenuCart£0.000Your cart is empty.LocationsBow LaneBrick LaneMayfairSpitalfieldsCanary WharfTreatmentsAppointmentsBook An AppointmentJack In The BoxShopStoryWhy UsBlogContactWork With UsJoin Jack’s ClubPromotionsMy AccountLoginSign UpSign InNew AccountUsername or Email AddressPasswordRemember MeForgot your password?Anti-spamCart£0.000Your cart is empty.Book NowCart£0.000Your cart is empty.LoginBook NowPrivacy PolicyPrivacy PolicyThis privacy policy applies between you, the User of this website and Jack The Clipper, the owner and provider of this Website.
